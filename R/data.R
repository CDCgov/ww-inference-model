#' Example wastewater dataset.
#'
#' A dataset containing the simulated wastewater concentrations
#' (labeled here as `log_genome_copies_per_ml`) by sample collection date
#' (`date`), the site where the sample was collected (`site`) and the lab
#' where the samples were processed (`lab`). Additional columns that are
#' required attributes needed for the model are the limit of detection for
#' that lab on each day (labeled here as `log_lod`) and the population size of
#' the wastewater catchment area represented by the wastewater concentrations
#' in each `site`.
#'
#' This data is generated via the default values in the
#'  `generate_simulated_data()` function. They represent the bare minumum
#'  required fields needed to pass to the model, and we recommend that users
#'  try to format their own data to match this format.
#'
#' The variables are as follows:
#'
#' @format ## ww_data
#' A tibble with 102 rows and 6 columns
#' \describe{
#'   \item{date}{Sample collection date, formatted in ISO8601 standards as
#'   YYYY-MM-DD}
#'   \item{site}{The wastewater treatment plant where the sample was collected}
#'   \item{lab}{The lab where the sample was processed}
#'   \item{log_genome_copies_per_ml}{The natural log of the wastewater
#'   concentration measured on the date specified, collected in the site
#'   specified, and processed in the lab specified. The package expects
#'   this quantity in units of log genome copies per mL.}
#'   \item{log_lod}{The log of the limit of detection in the site and lab on a
#'   particular day of the quantification device (e.g. PCR).  This should be in
#'    units of log genome copies per mL.}
#'   \item{site_pop}{The population size of the wastewater catchment area
#'   represented by the site variable}

#' Example hospital admissions dataset
#'
#'  A dataset containing the simulated daily hospital admissions
#' (labeled here as `daily_hosp_admits`) by date of admission (`date`).
#'  Additional columns that are required are the population size of the
#'  population contributing to the hospital admissions. It is assumed that
#'  the wastewater sites are subsets of this larger population, which
#'  is in the package data assumed to be from a hypothetical US state.
#'  The data generated are daily hospital admissions but they could be any other
#'  epidemiological count dataset e.g. cases. This data should only contain
#'  hospital admissions that would have been available as of the date that
#'  the forecast was made. We recommend that users try to format their data
#'  to match this format.
#'
#' This data is generated via the default values in the
#'  `generate_simulated_data()` function. They represent the bare minumum
#'  required fields needed to pass to the model, and we recommend that users
#'  try to format their own data to match this formate.

#' Global R(t) estimate dataset
#'
#'  A dataset containing the the simulated unadjusted daily R(t) estimate
#'  as well as the realized R(t) estimate for the overall "global" population.
#'  This realized R(t) is generated by summing the incident infections from
#'  each of the subpopulations (the populations in each wastewater catchment
#'  area plus an additional one representing the remainder of the population).
#'  The R(t) is then back-calculated by dividing the total incident infection
#'  time seres by the convolution of the infection time series and the
#'  generation interval.
#'
#' This data is generated via the default values in the
#'  `generate_simulated_data()` function.
#'
#' The variables are as follows:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{unadj_rt}{The daily global unadjusted R(t). The log of the
#'   unadjusted R(t) is the central value around which the subpopulation
#'   R(t) values are drawn from each week.}
#'   \item{realized_rt}{The daily value of the realized global R(t). This is
#'   calculated by summing up the subpopulation level incident infections and
#'   then dividing by the convolution of the total incident infections and the
#'   generation interval to get the R(t) value that corresponds to the
#'   global incident infections}
#'   \item{t}{The time index in days}

#' Example hospital admissions dataset for evaluation
#'
#'  A dataset containing the simulated daily hospital admissions that the model
#'  will be evaluated against (labeled here as `daily_hosp_admits_for_eval`)
#'  by date of admission (`date`). This data is not needed to fit the model,
#'  but is used in the Getting Started vignette to demonstrate the forecasted
#'  hospital admissions compared to those later observed.
#'
#' This data is generated via the default values in the
#'  `generate_simulated_data()` function.
#'
#' The variables are as follows:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{date}{Date the hospital admissions occurred, formatte din ISO8601
#'   standatds as YYYY-MM-DD}
#'   \item{daily_hosp_admits_for_eval}{The number of individuals admitted to the
#'   hospital on that date, available beyond the forecast date for evaluating

#'
#' \describe{
#' A vector that sums to 1, with each element representing the daily
#' probability of secondary onward transmission occurring on that day. The

#' occurred, it is assumed to be impossible for primary and secondary

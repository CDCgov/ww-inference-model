# wwinference

This will serve as our change-log
- Add functionality to fit the wastewater-informed model to an example fitting COVID-19 hospital admissions and wastewater from a few sites
- Add an example in the vignette to fit the model to only the hospital admissions. Plus a few small tweaks to the vignette.

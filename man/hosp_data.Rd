\description{
A dataset containing the simulated daily hospital admissions
(labeled here as \code{daily_hosp_admits}) by date of admission (\code{date}).
Additional columns that are required are the population size of the
population contributing to the hospital admissions. It is assumed that
the wastewater sites are subsets of this larger population, which
is in the package data assumed to be from a hypothetical US state.
The data generated are daily hospital admissions but they could be any other
epidemiological count dataset e.g. cases. This data should only contain
hospital admissions that would have been available as of the date that
the forecast was made. We recommend that users try to format their data
to match this format.

\details{
This data is generated via the default values in the
\code{generate_simulated_data()} function. They represent the bare minimum
required fields needed to pass to the model, and we recommend that users
try to format their own data to match this format.

The variables are as follows:
\describe{
\item{date}{Date the hospital admissions occurred, formatte din ISO8601
standatds as YYYY-MM-DD}
\item{daily_hosp_admits}{The number of individuals admitted to the
hospital on that date, available as of the forecast date}
\item{state_pop}{The number of people contributing to the daily hospital
admissions}
\item{location}{ A string indicating the location that all of the
data is coming from. This is not a necessary column, but instead is
included to more realistically mirror a typical workflow}
}

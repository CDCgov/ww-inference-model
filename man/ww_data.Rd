A tibble with 102 rows and 6 columns

\description{
A dataset containing the simulated wastewater concentrations
(labeled here as \code{log_genome_copies_per_ml}) by sample collection date
(\code{date}), the site where the sample was collected (\code{site}) and the lab
where the samples were processed (\code{lab}). Additional columns that are
required attributes needed for the model are the limit of detection for
that lab on each day (labeled here as \code{log_lod}) and the population size of
the wastewater catchment area represented by the wastewater concentrations
in each \code{site}.
}
\details{
This data is generated via the default values in the
\code{generate_simulated_data()} function. They represent the bare minumum
required fields needed to pass to the model, and we recommend that users
try to format their own data to match this format.

The variables are as follows:

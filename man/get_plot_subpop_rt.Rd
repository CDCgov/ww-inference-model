\title{Get plot of fit, nowcasted, and forecasted R(t) in each subpopulation}
\usage{
get_plot_subpop_rt(draws, forecast_date, n_draws_to_plot = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{draws}{A dataframe containing the posterior draws with the data joined
to it. This is \code{draws_df} output of the call to \code{\link[=wwinference]{wwinference()}}. It
expects the following column names: \code{date}, \code{pred_value}, \code{draw},
and \code{name}.}

\item{forecast_date}{A string indicating the date we made the forecast, for
plotting, in ISO8601 format YYYY-MM-DD}

\item{n_draws_to_plot}{An integer indicating how many draws from the
posterior to include in the plot, default is \code{100}}
}
\value{
A ggplot object containing faceted plots of the R(t) estimate in each
subpopulation (so wastewater sites + those not on wastewater)
}

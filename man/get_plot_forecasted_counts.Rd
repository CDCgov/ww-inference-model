\usage{
get_plot_forecasted_counts(
  draws,
  count_data_eval,
  count_data_eval_col_name,
  forecast_date,
  count_type = "hospital admissions"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{draws}{A dataframe containing the posterior draws with the data joined
to it. This is the \code{draws_df} output of a call to \code{\link[=wwinference]{wwinference()}}}

\item{count_data_eval}{A dataframe containing the count data we will
evaluate the forecasts against.}

\item{count_data_eval_col_name}{string indicating the name of the count
data to evaluate against the forecasted count data}

\item{forecast_date}{A string indicating the date we made the forecast, for
plotting, in ISO8601 format YYYY-MM-DD}

\item{count_type}{A string indicating what data the counts refer to,
default is \verb{hospital admissions}}
}
\value{
A ggplot object containing the posterior draw of the estimated,
nowcasted, and forecasted counts alongside the data used to
calibrate the model and subsequently observed counts (if any) against which
to evaluate the forecast performance.

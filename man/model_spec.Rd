\usage{
model_spec(
  forecast_date,
  calibration_time = 90,
  forecast_horizon = 28,
  generation_interval = wwinference::generation_interval,
  inf_to_count_delay = wwinference::inf_to_hosp,
  infection_feedback_pmf = wwinference::generation_interval,
  params = get_params(system.file("extdata", "example_params.toml", package =
    "wwinference"))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{forecast_date}{a character string in ISO8 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
indicating the date that the forecast is to be made. Default is}

\item{calibration_time}{integer indicating the number of days to calibrate
the model for, default is \code{90}}

\item{forecast_horizon}{integer indicating the number of days, including the
forecast date, to produce forecasts for, default is \code{28}}

\item{generation_interval}{vector of a simplex (must sum to 1) describing
the daily probability of onwards transmission, default is package data
provided for the COVID-19 generation interval post-Omicron}

\item{inf_to_count_delay}{vector of a simplex (must sum to 1) describing the
daily probability of transitioning from infection to whatever the count
variable is, e.g. hospital admissions or cases. Default corresonds to the
delay distribution from COVID-19 infection to hospital admission}

\item{infection_feedback_pmf}{vector of a simplex (must sum to 1) describing
the delay from incident infection to feedback in the transmission dynamics.
The default is the COVID-19 generation interval}

\item{params}{a 1 row dataframe of parameters corresponding to model
priors and disease/data specific parameters. Default is for COVID-19 hospital
admissions and viral concentrations in wastewater}
}
\value{
a list of model specs to be passed to the \code{get_stan_data()} function
}
\description{
This function returns a nested list containing the model specifications
in the function arguments. All defaults are set for the case of fitting a
post-omicron COVID-19 model with joint inference of hospital admissions
and data on wastewater viral concentrations
}

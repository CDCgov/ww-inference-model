Description: An implementation of a hierarchical semi-mechanistic renewal
    approach jointly calibrating to multiple wastewater concentrations datasets from
    subsets of a specified population and epidemioliogical indicators such as cases
    or hospital admissions from the whole population. Our framework is an extension
    of the widely used semi-mechanistic renewal framework EpiNow2, using a Bayesian
    latent variable approach implemented in the probabilistic programming language
    Stan. This package contains just the core components needed to fit these two
    data sources and produce the following outputs-- estimated and forecasted
    hospital admissions, estimated and forecasted wastewater concentrations,
    global R(t) estimates, local R(t) estimates for the subpopulations
    represented by each wastewater catchment area.

## Overview

This project is an in-development R package, `{wwinference}` that estimates latent incident infections from wastewater concentration data and data on epidemiological indicators, with an initial assumed structure that the wastewater concentration data comes from subsets of the population contributing to the "global" epidemiological indicator data, such as hospital admissions.
In brief, our model builds upon [EpiNow2](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2/tree/main), a widely used [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) package for Bayesian epidemiological inference.
We modify EpiNow2 to add model for the observed viral RNA concentration in wastewater, adding hierarchical structure to link the subpopulations represented by the osberved wastewater concentrations in each wastewater catchment area.
See our Model Definition page for a mathematical description of the generative model, and the Getting Stated vignette to see an example of how to run the inference model on simulated data.

The intention is for {wwinference} to provide a user-friendly R-package interface for running forecasting models that use wastewater concentrations combined with other more traditional epidemiological signals such as cases or hospital admissions. It aims to be a re-implementation of the modeling components contained in the [wastewater-informed-covid-forecasting](https://github.com/CDCgov/wastewater-informed-covid-forecasting) project repository, with
an emphasis here on making it easier for users to supply their own data.

We recommend reading the [model definition](model_definition.md) to learn more about how the model is structured and running the ["Getting Started" vignette](vignettes/wwinference.Rmd) for an example of how to fit the model to simulated data of COVID-19 hospital admissions and wastewater concentrations.
This will help make clear the data requirements and how to structure this data to fit the model.

# Installing and running code

## Install R
To run our code, you will need a working installation of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version `4.3.0` or later). You can find instructions for installing R on the official [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/).

## Install `cmdstanr` and `CmdStan`
We do inference from our models using [`CmdStan`](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) (version `2.35.0` or later) via its R interface [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) (version `0.8.0` or later).

Open an R session and run the following command to install `cmdstanr` per that package's [official installation guide](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/#installation).

```R
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
```

`cmdstanr` provides tools for installing `CmdStan` itself. First check that everything is properly configured by running:

```R
cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain()
```

You should see the following:
```
The C++ toolchain required for CmdStan is setup properly!
```

If you do, you can then install `CmdStan` by running:
```R
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```
If installation succeeds, you should see a message like the following:
```
CmdStan path set to: {a path on your file system}
```

If you run into trouble, consult the official [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/index.html) website for further installation guides and help.

## Install `wwinference`

Once `cmdstanr` and `CmdStan` are installed, the next step is to download this repository and install the package, `wwinference`. The package provides tools for specifying and running the model, and installs other needed dependencies.

### User install

The package can be installed directly from github by running the following within an R session:
```R
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("CDCgov/ww-inference-model")
```
## R dependencies
Installing the project package should take care of almost all dependencies installations. Confirm that package installation has succeeded by running the following within an R session:

```R
library(wwinference)
```
